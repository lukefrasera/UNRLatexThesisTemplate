 - It abides by the style required by the department and makes it easy to
   write a thesis document. Please read through comments to understand how to
   use this document. There are several steps involved. And there is a word
   document that is required to build the document fully.
 - A MakeFile was provided as well to help build the document. You can use
   to build the document into a PDF format.
 - A pdfshrink.sh file is also provided to help shrink the final thesis
   document to email to others and submit. This is a very useful utility as it
   can shrink a 50MB pdf down to potentially 3MB. This is very useful!!
 - Many folder are provided as well for structure. 
   - The [images] folder is where images should go. If you place an image in
     that folder you should not need to supply an extension of directory when
     including graphics into your document.

     difficult aspect of the thesis setup.
